# Hi, I'm Jacob! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve spent the 10 years building scalable architecture, shipping production code, and mentoring engineers at high-growth startups. I am a competent Full Stack Engineer skilled at building frontend, backend, and infrastructure for data and LLM focused applications using Typescript, React, Python, and NodeJS. Having led multiple teams at earlier stage startups, I'm ready to use my experience to drive success at a more mature organization.
